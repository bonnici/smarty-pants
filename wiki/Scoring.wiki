#summary How scoring will work.

= Introduction =

This is pretty tricky because it isn't clear what should depend on what, e.g. you could give tracks a higher score based on the top artists but you could also give artists a score based on the score of their tracks.


= Details =

Each track has:
  * A track name
  * An artist name
  * A list of the tracks that it is related to, with scores (the results from track.getSimilar)
  * A list of the tracks that are related to it, with scores (inverse of above)

Each artist has:
  * An artist name
  * A list of tracks (with play count if available)
