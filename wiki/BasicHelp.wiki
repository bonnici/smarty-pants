#summary How to use Smarty Pants

= Basic Usage =

Using Smarty Pants is simple, just select one or more songs and hit the Start button. Smarty Pants will find songs and artist that are similar to the selected songs and display them in three tabs. The "Reset" button will clear all the tabs and allow you to select another song to start processing.

The "Playlist" tab shows songs that are in your library, ordered by how similar they are to the selected song or songs. You can double click on the songs in this list to start playing them in Songbird, and after a track finishes it will act like a playlist and go on to the next song or a random song depending on whether shuffle is enabled or not. The playlist can be saved by selecting a number of minutes or tracks, and clicking on the "Save" button. If both the number of minutes and the number of tracks are set to 0, all the songs in the list will be saved. If you right click on songs in the list, there are options to play the song, to open the song or artist in last.fm, or to play the artist radio. 

The "Recommended" tab shows songs that are similar to the selected song but could not be found in your library. It shows the artist and track name as well as whether or not the song is streamable in last.fm. "No" means the song cannot be streamed (but there might still be a video that can be played), "Yes" means that the song can be previewed, and "Full" means that the whole song can be played and the track might be downloadable. There is a dropdown list down the bottom of the tab that will let you show all songs, only the songs that can be streamed, and only the songs that can be fully streamed. Double clicking on a track will open the song in last.fm and start playing it if it is streamable. If you right click on a track, there are options to open the song or artist in last.fm, or to play the artist radio.

The "Artists" tab shows the artist that you selected as well as any artists that are similar. It also shows a list of the recommended albums for the artist that are not in your library. Clicking on the artist name or picture will open the artist in last.fm, and clicking on the album name or picture will open the album in last.fm. There is also a little red radio icon that can be clicked on to start playing the artist's radio.
